This is a simple plugin for the SiriProxy which can be found here:
https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/

This allows the user to use siri to do a few simple commands which control the mac running the proxy.

Currently you can try...

"Open Google."
"Open Twitter." 
"Open LaunchPad." (Only for Lion users)
"Close LaunchPad." (Just the same as above, only done for wording reasons)
"Open Applications Folder."
"Open iTunes." (Only applicable if iTunes is located in the default /Applications/ directory.)
"Bake me a cake." (only for fun..)


iTunes Controls....
the following commands allow you to use siri to control your mac's iTunes.
However a script is needed which can be located here:

Once saved and put in the correct directory with permissions 0755 and the name 'itunes', you may use the following commands.

"Mac play." 
"Mac pause."
"Mac next song."
"Mac last song."
"Mac mute." (only mutes iTunes, not the system wide volume)
"Mac unmute."

That is currently all I added, it is very simple and quick to add more!

Enjoy!
